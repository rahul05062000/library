Library Web Application
This is a simple web application built using Django, HTML, and CSS. The purpose of this application is to allow users to add and view details about 
different types of books in a library.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python and Django installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can clone this 
repository to your local machine and run the following commands to start the application:

Copy code
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
These commands will create the necessary database tables and start the development server. You can then access the application by navigating
to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Usage
Once you have the application running, you can add new books to the library by clicking the "Add Book" button on the home page. This will take you to 
a form where you can enter details about the book, such as the title, author, and genre.

After you have added some books, you can view the list of books by clicking the "View Books" button on the home page. This will take you to a page 
that displays a table of all the books in the library.
